<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there are some general guidelines you can follow to ensure your pizza comes out perfectly every time. Here are the five best tips for getting your pizza cook time just right:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Preheat your oven to the proper temperature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a traditional pizza, you'll want to preheat your oven to between 425 and 450 degrees Fahrenheit. If you're using a thin crust dough, you may need to cook your pizza at a slightly higher temperature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Roll or stretch your dough to the desired thickness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The thickness of your dough will also affect your cook time. A thicker crust will take longer to cook than a thinner crust.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Add your toppings and sauce.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be sure to add your toppings and sauce before you bake your pizza. This will help to ensure that your toppings don't slide off during the baking process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4. Bake your pizza on a preheated pizza stone or baking sheet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A pizza stone or baking sheet will help to ensure that your pizza cooks evenly. If you don't have either of these, you can bake your pizza directly on the oven rack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5. Check your pizza regularly during cooking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pizza can go from perfectly cooked to burnt in a matter of minutes. Therefore, it's important to check on your pizza frequently during the cooking process.</p>
